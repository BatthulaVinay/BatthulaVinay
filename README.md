# 👋 Hi, I'm Batthula Vinay

🎓 **M.Tech – Smart Electric Grid (EEE)** | NIT Warangal  
🤖 **Machine Learning & AI Enthusiast**  
🛠️ **ML Engineer in progress | System-oriented learner**

I build end-to-end Machine Learning solutions — from data analysis and model training to API development and lightweight deployment. I focus on practical, real-world applications rather than isolated experiments.

- 🤖 Building ML & basic DL models
- 🧠 NLP experiments (text classification, preprocessing, embeddings)
- 🌐 Creating ML APIs using **FastAPI**
- 🐳 Containerizing ML projects with **Docker**
- 📈 Building interactive ML apps using **Streamlit**
- 🔜 Gradually moving toward **LLMs, RAG, and applied AI systems**
